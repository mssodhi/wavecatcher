    "description": "Chicken hop is a 2D single player game based on the popular Doodle Jump game. I started this project when I came across a game dev tutorial, and started experimenting with iOS games. Originally I wrote the game in Objective-C, but then ported over the game in Swift as it was the new language supported by Apple. Overall I learned a lots from building this game ranging from game dev/coding principles, to how to develop and launch an app in production.",

    "description": "I was sitting at home over Winter break when I saw a video by Facebook CEO Mark Juckerberg where he was showing his Personal Artificial Intelligence Assistant Jarvis. I was truly inspired by the whole demo, and soon started working on my own Jarvis. Although I didn't know how to do everything Mark's Jarvis could do, I decided to start anyways, and start small. For the starters, I decided to get voice recognition working on an iOS app which would connect to a server running on my laptop. From that, I decided to hard code a few commands so I could control Spotify app on my laptop. So I had Jarvis controlling music on my laptop. Next I wanted Jarvis to control the lights in my room. Soon I realized hard coding commands would not be scalable, so I enrolled in Artificial Intelligence course my last quarter at UC Davis. I'll start working on Jarvis soon, so an update will be coming soon."
